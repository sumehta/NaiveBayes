**Binary Classification using Naive Bayes**

This project is naive in every way in the sense that, it performs supervised binary classification using Naive Bayes. Nevertheless, it is good practice for anyone getting started with machine learning. Performs binary classification for a dataset of a set of patients along with their physical attributes and predicts how likely are they to contract diabetes.
